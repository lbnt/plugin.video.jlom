Kodi plugin "Just Lists Of Movies"

A basic kodi plugin to help choose a good movie to watch using recommendation from trusted sources

## Intro
This plugin displays lists of movies classified into different categories.
It tries to find these movies in your library so you can watch them without waiting.

The lists presented have been scraped from reputable sites and converted into a JSON format usable by this plugin.
The lists of movies are stored and so downloaded from a server located at https://jlom.fly.dev

There are 2 types of lists:
- list of folders : which are high-level lists to classify the movies (example https://jlom.fly.dev/folder_list?id=the_very_best)
- list of movies : the actual list of movies (example https://jlom.fly.dev/folder_list?id=BFI-greatest_films_of_all_time)
